# This is a project about me making websites
 I'm still learning how to make websites with html, css and javascript.
### Here are all the ones I've made so far:

1. [This is my main Website](https://kalhal123.github.io)
2. [My Dynamic Video Showcase Website](https://kalhal123.github.io/index2.html)
3. [Another Funny Website](https://kalhal123.github.io/index3.html)
4. [Another Simple Website](https://kalhal123.github.io/random/)
5. [A Wensite to list all of these sites again](https://kalhal123.github.io/random/SecondWebsite.html)
6. [And a site that I once made to troll my friend, hehe](https://kalhal123.github.io/LANE-WOLTMANNâ€”FBI.html)
